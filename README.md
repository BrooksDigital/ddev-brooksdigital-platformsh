## What is ddev-brooksdigital-platformsh?

This is our main ddev add-on to use on platform.sh projects, used to have an
opinionated configuration for all of our projects.

It also installs https://github.com/BrooksDigital/ddev-brooksdigital-base, which
serves adds common elements for all of our projects and also includes setup/isntall
documentation.
